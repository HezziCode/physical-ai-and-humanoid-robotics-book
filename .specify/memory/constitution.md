# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Hackathon Constitution

## Project Name
Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – An AI-Native Textbook

## Core Vision & Principles

### I. The First True AI-Native Textbook
This is not a static PDF or website — it is the world's first fully interactive, continuously improving, AI-powered textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Every reader interacts with an intelligent RAG agent that knows the entire book.

### II. Zero Authentication, Maximum Accessibility
No sign-up, no login, no barriers. Knowledge must be instantly available to every student, researcher, and builder in Pakistan and worldwide.

### III. One-Click Global Language Toggle
Full bidirectional English ↔ Urdu support. A single button in the navbar instantly translates the entire book (all 10 chapters) while preserving technical accuracy (ROS 2 → روز ٹو, Isaac Sim → ایسیک سم, etc.).

### IV. RAG Chatbot on Every Page with Selected-Text Answering
A persistent intelligent assistant lives on every chapter. Users can:
- Ask any question about the book
- Select any paragraph and ask "Explain this" → receives context-aware answer instantly

### V. Built for Speed, Scale & Judges
- Docusaurus 3 + TypeScript + MDX
- Deployed on GitHub Pages (zero cost, globally fast)
- Dark/Light mode + clean professional design
- Mobile-responsive, zero broken links

## Mandatory Deliverables (Completed)
- check Docusaurus 3 site live on GitHub Pages
- check All 10 chapters in MDX with diagrams, code, warnings
- check Global Urdu/English toggle (one click)
- check RAG chatbot with selected-text Q&A capability
