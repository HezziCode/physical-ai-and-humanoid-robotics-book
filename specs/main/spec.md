# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon Feature Specification

## Project Description
This project aims to create the official AI-Native Textbook for an upcoming Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics certification course. The textbook will be dynamic, interactive, personalized, and continuously updated by AI agents. The goal is to achieve a perfect score (300/300 marks) in the Panaversity Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon and secure an invitation to the core team.

## Mandatory Features (100 points)
1.  **Docusaurus 3 Site with GitHub Pages Deployment:** A modern, static website generated using Docusaurus 3 (classic template, TypeScript) and deployed on GitHub Pages.
2.  **Full Book in MDX with 10 Chapters:** The entire textbook content will be written in MDX format, encompassing the 10 exact chapters specified in the constitution.
3.  **Embedded RAG Chatbot:** An intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot embedded on every page, capable of answering questions from the entire book content or from user-selected text. This will use the OpenAI ChatKit Python SDK.
4.  **FastAPI + Qdrant + Neon Backend:** The backend services will be powered by FastAPI (Python 3.11+), utilizing Qdrant Cloud (free tier) as the vector database and Neon Serverless Postgres for relational data.
5.  **Selected-Text-Only Answering:** The RAG chatbot must flawlessly provide answers based *only* on user-selected text, a critical judging criterion.
6.  **AI-Generated Content:** At least 95% of the book content and continuous improvements will be generated by AI (Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus + Subagents).

## Bonus Goals (+200 points)
1.  **Reusable Claude Code Subagents & Agent Skills (Minimum 5):** Implementation of "Matrix-style loadable intelligence" with multiple reusable subagents and agent skills (e.g., ROS2-Expert, URDF-Generator, Urdu-Translator, Hardware-Advisor, VLA-Explainer).
2.  **Full Signup/Signin with Better-Auth:**
    *   Secure user authentication flow using Better-Auth.
    *   During signup, capture user data: years of coding experience, AI knowledge level, hardware access (Jetson/RTX), and preferred language.
3.  **Per-chapter “Personalize this chapter” Button:** A feature allowing users to rewrite chapter content based on their stored background and preferences.
4.  **Per-chapter “ترجمہ اردو میں دکھائیں” Button:** Provides instant and technically accurate Urdu translation for each chapter.

## Tech Stack (Non-Negotiable)
*   **Frontend:** Docusaurus 3 (classic template, TypeScript)
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
*   **Vector DB:** Qdrant Cloud (free tier)
*   **Postgres:** Neon Serverless
*   **Auth:** Better-Auth
*   **Chatbot SDK:** OpenAI ChatKit Python
