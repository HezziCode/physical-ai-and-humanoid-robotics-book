## Prompt

Generate a detailed, high-quality MDX chapter titled "Chapter 5: Sensors for Robotic Perception". Include the following sections: "Introduction to Robotic Sensors (Vision, Proximity, Force, IMU)", "Vision Sensors: Cameras (Monocular, Stereo, Depth) and Image Processing Basics", "Proximity and Distance Sensors (Ultrasonic, IR, Lidar)", "Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) for Orientation and Motion", "Force and Torque Sensors for Interaction", "Hands-on Project: Environment Mapping with Lidar (or similar sensor) on ROS 2", and "Sensor Fusion Techniques for Enhanced Perception". Include rich formatting, detailed code examples (Python for image processing/ROS 2, Arduino C++ for basic sensor reads), and suggestions for diagrams. Focus on clarity, accuracy, and practical application for robotics. Do NOT include any buttons for translation or personalization in this output.

## Response snapshot

Generated a detailed MDX chapter titled "Chapter 5: Sensors for Robotic Perception" covering various sensor types, image processing, distance sensors, IMUs, force sensors, a hands-on Lidar mapping project with ROS 2, and sensor fusion techniques. The chapter includes rich formatting, Python and Arduino C++ code examples, and suggestions for diagrams.
